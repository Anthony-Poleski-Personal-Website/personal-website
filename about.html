        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          In my free time I enjoy playing chess, exercising, and saltwater
          fishing.

        <h2>Chess</h2>
        <p>
          Chess is my favorite boardgame. I enjoy spending my Saturday mornings drinking a cup of coffee and playing a
          traditional over-the-board game of chess.

        <h2>Exercising</h2>
        <p>
          Late 2022 I sprained the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in my left
          knee. It hurt, a lot. I spent days in bed with my knee iced and raised.  When I was able, I started exercising to help my
          knee recover. Slowly I incorporated a full-body workout into my workout routine.
          After seeing some positive results, I decided to eat healthier as well. Now I exercise three times a week and monitor my diet via my FitBit app.  Since my injury, I've lost at least twenty pounds and I feel a lot better overall.
          Surprisingly, injuring my knee has actually helped me become healthier.

        <h2>Fishing</h2>
        <p>
          If I'm not working, playing chess, or exercising, I'm probably fishing
          somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico. Fishing brings me peace and also
          excitement. Nothing like a day fishing.
