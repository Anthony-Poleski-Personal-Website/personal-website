      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>In my free time I enjoy playing chess, exercising, and saltwater fishing.</p>
      <p>
        <h2>Chess</h2>
        Chess is my favorite boardgame. I enjoy a cup of coffee and a traditional over-the-board game of chess.

    <p><h2>Exercising</h2>
        Late 2022 I sprained the medial collateral ligament (MCL) in my left knee.  It hurt, a lot.  When I was able I started exercising to help my knee recover.  Slowly I incorporated a full-body workout to my routine.  After seeing some positive results I started changing my diet for the better. I lost a lot of weight and I feel a lot better overall.  Hurting my knee actually helped me become healthier.

    <p><h2>Fishing</h2>
        If I'm not working, playing chess, or exercising, I'm probably fishing somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico.  Fishing brings me peace and also excitement.  Nothing like a day fishing.<img src="fish.png" alt="image of barracuda"></p>
